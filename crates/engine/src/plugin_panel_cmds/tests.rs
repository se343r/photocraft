//! `plugin.panel.*` end to end: a panel opens, its view is kept for the UI, a click reaches it, and
//! the operations it answers with are carried out — or refused, but always answered.
//!
//! Each fixture's `pc_event` answers with a fixed script, and then **echoes the event it is given**
//! straight back inside a `storage.set`. That makes the event the host delivered readable from a
//! test, byte for byte — which is how the timer fires and the refusals are checked. The one event a
//! scripted fixture does not treat that way is a tick's `doc.changed`, which another test's session
//! can deliver at any moment: see [`tick_guard`].
//!
//! The installed plug-ins *and* the open panels are process-wide, so one id belongs to one test: a
//! second test using it installs over the first one's instance, and the panel it is clicking becomes
//! someone else's. A tick reaches every panel in the process too, so the tests that tick take
//! [`ticking`] first.
