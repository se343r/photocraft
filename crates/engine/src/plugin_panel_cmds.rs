//! `plugin.panel.*`: ABI v2 panel plug-ins — one live instance the host drives with events, which
//! answers with operations for the host to carry out.
//!
//! A panel keeps one instance per plug-in for the life of the process. Hiding it only tells it so:
//! its state, timers and blobs stay. Only a failure, `plugin.remove` or an explicit
//! `plugin.panel.close {"stop":true}` ends the instance, so a panel's own model survives exactly as
//! long as the app does.
//!
//! Every command that touches a panel drives it the same way — queue an event, pump the queue, carry
//! out what comes back, repeat until the panel settles — so a click in the panel and the same
//! `plugin.panel.event` from a test or an agent are one code path.
//!
//! What this build carries out, and what it refuses:
//!
//! | Operation | Here |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ui.view`, `ui.set`, `ui.progress`, `ui.notice` | kept for the UI to render (`plugin.panel.inspect`) |
//! | `timer.set`, `timer.clear` | armed on the instance; `plugin.panel.tick` fires them |
//! | `storage.set` | kept per plug-in, in memory for now |
//! | `blob.free` | releases the blob |
//! | `doc.info` | answered from [`crate::inspect::document`] — the size, the layer stack, the selection bounds |
//! | `doc.command` | run, if the manifest asks for the capability and the host's own list allows it (see [`permissions`]) |
//! | `doc.capture`, `doc.commit`, `http.request` | **refused**, with an `ok: false` result |
//!
//! Those refusals are answers, not silence: the panel is told what happened, so it can say so. The
//! pixels and the network are the host work still to come; the sandbox, the limits and the failure
//! handling they will run under are already here.
//!
//! Instances are driven on the calling thread, under one process-wide lock. A hostile panel is
//! bounded by one 2 s wall-clock budget per host call — shared by every event that call pumps, not
//! granted afresh to each — and is then stopped for good, so it can delay other panels by at most
//! that; giving each instance its own worker thread is the next step.
